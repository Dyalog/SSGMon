# SSGMon
The Dyalog Security Group's Security Issue Monitor - SSGMon - has been developed by Dyalog to monitor public security issues related to third party software that is used or re-distributed by Dyalog, and also issues in our internal issue tracking system Mantis, which have been tagged as security issues.

It sends status e-mail to the SSG at Dyalog. It is designed to run regularly during the week to inform the security group of status changes, and once a week to provide an overview of all open issues and all third party components being tracked.

SSGMon is for internal use at Dyalog, but the repository is public so that the code can be used as inspiration for anyone needing to do something similar.

It is provided "as is" and without documentation under MIT licence.
