# SSGMon
The Dyalog Security Group's Security Issue Monitor - SSGMon - has been developed by Dyalog to monitor:

* Published security issues related to third party software that is used or re-distributed by Dyalog
* Issues tagged as "security related" in our internal issue tracking system Mantis

SSGMon is run every hour in a mode where it sends e-mail summarising changes since the last run. It also runs once a week in the mode where it provides an overview of all open secuirty issues and a list of the third party components that are being tracked.

SSGMon is for internal use at Dyalog, but the repository is public so that the code can be used as inspiration for anyone needing to do something similar.

It is provided "as is" and without documentation under MIT licence.
